* Falconpanel

An Arduino program for surfacing switches and knobs as a USB game
controller.

** Show Me

Here's a video demonstrating the features of Falconpanel:

** Status

Alpha - all code subject to change. May cause tingling in the extremities.

** What's with the name?

I developed this in the process of building a control panel for my
favorite flight simulator [[http://www.bmsforum.org/forum/content.php][Falcon BMS]]. However, since this surfaces the
Arduino as a regular USB game controller, there's really no reason
that it has to be used just with Falcon; it should work with any
program that's expecting DirectX buttons or axes.

** My Hardware

The buttons and switches are at the left edge. The thing in the middle
is a [[http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard][Logitech G13]] that I use for the ICP/DED, and has nothing to do
with Falconpanel, other than sitting on the same stand. The point of
the picture is to show how I was able to make a pretty simple panel by
drilling some holes in some 1/4" plywood and mounting various things
in it. Here's a shot of the back:

The hardware I used:

- An [[http://www.adafruit.com/products/849][Arduino Leonardo]]
- An [[http://www.adafruit.com/products/192][Adafruit Protoshield]]
- A [[http://www.adafruit.com/products/64][tiny breadboard]]

But you can use any Arduino, you don't need the protoshield nor the
breadboard, and you can use whatever switches, knobs, and buttons you
like. I used these.

** The software

*** Prerequisities

If you want to compile and build exactly what I did (unlikely), you'll
need to install the Arduino tools and then - as the key part of all
this - [[https://github.com/NicoHood/HID][The HID Project libraries]]. NicoHood has done all the hard work
here, and I will refer you to his documentation for installation.

*** Falconpanel features

The key idea in Falconpanel is that of *Components*. These map
physical controls and other electronics to USB buttons and axes. You
will need to map these to your particular setup by modifying the code
in Falconpanel that looks like this:

#+begin_src cpp
  Component* components[] =   {
    // List the mux here so its setup gets called
    mux1,
    // Taxi lights (on mux input 3)
    new OnOffSwitch(new IC54LS151InputLine(mux1, 3),
                    new DxButton(1),
                    new DxButton(2),
                    3),
    // FACK
    new PushButton(new DigitalInputPullupPin(6), new DxButton(3)),
    // Master Caution
    new PushButton(new DigitalInputPullupPin(7), new DxButton(4)),
    // Laser Arm
    new OnOffSwitch(new DigitalInputPullupPin(8),
                    new DxButton(5),
                    new DxButton(6),
                    3),
    // Master Arm
    new OnOffOnSwitch(new DigitalInputPullupPin(9),
                      new DigitalInputPullupPin(10),
                      new DxButton(7),
                      new DxButton(8),
                      new DxButton(9),
                      3),
    // Parking Brake
    new OnOffSwitch(new DigitalInputPullupPin(11),
                    new DxButton(10),
                    new DxButton(11),
                    3),
    // HMCS
    new SwitchingRotary(new AnalogInputPin(0),
                        DxAxis::XRotation(),
                        new DxButton(12),
                        new DxButton(13),
                        3,
                        0.05),
    // A/R Door
    new OnOffSwitch(new DigitalInputPullupPin(12),
                    new DxButton(14),
                    new DxButton(15),
                    3)
  };
#+end_src

Falconpanel currently supports the following types of component

**** PushButton

The simplest of the controls, this maps a Arduino input pin directly
to a DirectX button. Intended to be connect to a momentary, pushbutton
switch.
Constructor:

#+begin_src cpp
PushButton(DigitalInput* in, DxButton* dxButton)
#+end_src

Watches the digital input =in= and maps it to DirectX button
=dxButton= (DirectX buttons are numbered from 1, with a max of 32).
The DirectX button stays pressed for as long as the physical button
does.

**** OnOffSwitch

Maps a two-position switch to DirectX buttons for its *up* and *down*
states. The DirectX button presses are momentary, even though the
switch is not.

Constructor:

#+begin_src cpp
OnOffSwitch(DigitalInput* in, DxButton* dxButtonUp, DxButton* dxButtonDown, int duration)
#+end_src

Watches the digital input =in=, and when it changes state,
presses DirectX button =dxButtonUp= or =dxButtonDown= (DirectX buttons
are numbered from 1, with a max of 32) depending on whether the switch
has been flipped up or down. The button stays pressed for =duration=
"ticks", or until the switch state is changed. A tick is currently
about 150ms.

Note that one switch therefore generates two different DirectX button
presses.

**** OnOffOnSwitch

Maps a three-position switch to DirectX buttons for its *up*,
*middle*, and *down* states. The DirectX button presses are momentary,
even though the switch is not.

Constructor:

#+begin_src cpp
  OnOffOnSwitch(DigitalInput* inUp, DigitalInput* inDown,
                DxButton* dxButtonUp, DxButton* dxButtonMiddle, DxButton* dxButtonDown,
                int duration)
#+end_src

Watches the digital inputs =inUp= and =inDown=, which should be
connected to the up and down leads of the physical switch, and when
the switch changes state, presses DirectX button =dxButtonUp=,
=dxButtonMiddle=, or =dxButtonDown= (DirectX buttons are numbered from
1, with a max of 32) depending on which position the switch has been
flipped to. The button stays pressed for =duration= "ticks", or until
the switch state is changed. A tick is currently about 150ms.

Note that one switch therefore generates three different DirectX button
presses.

**** SwitchingRotary

Maps a potentiometer to a DirectX axis and two buttons - one for
"switching on" and one for "switching off". Note that there is no need
to use a potentiometer with an actual switch - on/off state is tracked
by watching whether the pot is below a configurable threshold.

Constructor:

#+begin_src cpp
  SwitchingRotary(AnalogInput* in,
                  DxAxis* dxAxis, DxButton* dxButtonOn, DxButton* dxButtonOff,
                  int duration, float threshold)
#+end_src

Watches the analog input =in=, which should be connected to the middle
lead of a potentiometer, ideally in the 10K Ohm range. When the pot is
below =threshold=, reports the specified DirectX axis as being at its
minimum value. When above =threshold=, reports values scaled between
the minimum and maximum DirectX axis values.

When the pot passes through the threshold value in the increasing
direction, sends a momentary press on DirectX button =dxButtonOn=.
When the pot passes through the threshold value in the decreasing
direction, sends a momentary press on DirectX button =dxButtonOff=.
Momentary presses are of duration =duration= ticks, where a tick is
currently about 150ms.

Note that one pot therefore generates two different DirectX button
presses and one DirectX axis.

**** IC74LS151

Represents a 74LS151 3-to-8 mulitplexer (mux). These can be used to
multiplex three input pins and one output pin on the Arduino to 8
input pins on the mux, effectively doubling the number of input wires
you can have connected to a single Arduino.

=IC74LS151= is a component mainly so it can be listed in the
components array and have its setup function called; the primary use
of it is via its =input= method, which is an adapter that bridges from
an IC54LS151 mux instance to anything that's expecting a digital
input, like the =PushButton= class.

Constructor:

#+begin_src cpp
IC74LS151(DigitalOutput* dout0, DigitalOutput* dout1, DigitalOutput* dout2, DigitalInput* din)
#+end_src

Sets up a 74LS151 multiplexer with its address lines driven by =dout0=
(LSB), =dout1=, and =dout2= (MSB). Input will arrive on =din=. Use the
=input= method to connect the input pins of the mux to other controls,
as in this example:

#+begin_src cpp
  // I've got a 74LS151 3-to-8 mux with its address pins connected to
  // Arduino pins 2-4, and with its output pin connected to Arduino pin
  // 5. We have to declare this outside the components array below
  // because we reference it in there.
  IC74LS151* mux1 = new IC74LS151(new DigitalOutputPin(2),
                                  new DigitalOutputPin(3),
                                  new DigitalOutputPin(4),
                                  new DigitalInputPullupPin(5));

  // A simple example with only one control connect to the mux.
  // Ordinarily you would connect several, since saving Arduino pins is
  // the point of the mux.
  Component* components[] =  {
    // List the mux here so its setup gets called
    mux1,
    // Connect an On/Off switch to the mux input 3 (D3 on the data sheet)
    new OnOffSwitch(mux1->input(3),
                    new DxButton(1),
                    new DxButton(2),
                    3)
  };
#+end_src
